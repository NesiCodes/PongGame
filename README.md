<br>The program is a ping pong/hockey multiplayer game that can be played by 2 players at the same time using different keys. The game starts with a welcome screen and buttons to start the game etc. Each player can control his own paddle and it should not allow the ball to pass through or the other players wins a point. Players cant move their paddles off the screen.The ball spawns at the middle of the screen and heads in a random direction. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off when it touches the walls to make the game more challenging for both players, also the ball speed increases each times it intersects with the paddles to make the game harder and more challenging. The game has abilities that spawn randomly through the field and gives the player that hits them advantages like: speed increase, size increase, ball speed, ball size etc. There are buttons that allow players to pause reset or quit from the game. The first player to hit 10 points wins and a game over with the winning player accours and it gives the option to start again.
